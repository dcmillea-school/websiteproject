            <h4>üìú The Battle of the Ages: Thatrick vs. Jesus & Mohammond</h4>
            <p style="margin: 24px 0px">
              ‚Äî The battlefield was set in the vast empty region of shreksville,
              a place where time and space bent and twisted. On one side stood
              Jesus, the Messiah, with divine compassion and unparalleled
              wisdom. On the other stood Mohammond, a godly force of willpower
              and discipline. The stakes? The fate of all reality.
            </p>

            <hr style="border: 2px solid green" />
            <ul class="white-list">
              <li>
                Thatrick struck first driving Jesus into the void, leaving him
                stunned and confused.
              </li>
              <li>
                Mohammond quickly attacked Thatrick with his harsh words. And
                Thatrick was deeply hurt. Thatrick never knew how much words
                could hurt him.
              </li>
              <li>
                Before Thatrick could recover Jesus got up and punched Thatrick
                in the stomach.
              </li>
              <li>
                Jesus laughed with a sense of purity and forgiveness. Mohammand
                took advantage of the situation and called upon
                <span style="font-weight: 800" class="about-extra"
                  >Ra the Sun God
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                Ra came down the stairs from the sun, but he tripped and died.
              </li>
              <li>
                Thatrick rose up and quickly attacked Jesus and Mohammad at the
                same time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Thatrick defeated both of them, and they were begging for his
                mercy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Before the final blow was struk, the most evil and heinous
                character emerged from the void. The spongebob look-a-like,
                <span style="font-weight: 800" class="about-extra">
                  Doodle Bob </span
                >. Doodle Bob drew a portle, and flug Thatrick into the future.
                Now Thatrick is trapped inside the minecraft servers and seeks
                to return to the past to undue the future that is Doodle Bob!
              </li>
              <li>
                Important Note: Thatrick has yet to be found in the Minecraft
                Servers as of writing this in 2025, The CIA, KBG, and LGBT elite
                organizations have failed to find him. The future remains
                uncertain...
