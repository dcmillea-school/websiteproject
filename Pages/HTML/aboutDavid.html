        <p class="about-extra">
          I love writing. Right now, I’m wrapping up a book I’ve been working on, and I hope it’s just the beginning. I want to write many more and, God-willing, become a well-renowned author whose words move people. One day, I hope one of my stories is turned into a movie. That would be a dream come true.
        </p>
        <p class="about-extra">
          I’m passionate about making the world a better place — not just in big gestures, but in the daily effort of doing better than I did yesterday. I strive to make choices that honor my family, my countries, and the future generations that will come after me.
        </p>
        <p class="about-extra">
          I consider myself a leader. I'm always learning how to become a better one — through faith, responsibility, and growth. I believe in God — in Jesus Christ — and I fully trust His plan for my life.

        <p class="about-extra">
          I’ve come a long way — in life, in distance, and in faith. Being healthy and having the opportunity to attend school in the United States is a blessing I don’t take for granted. Every day is a gift. I’m here to make the most of it.
