              I love writing. Right now, Iâ€™m wrapping up a book Iâ€™ve been
              working on, and I hope itâ€™s just the beginning. I want to write
              many more and, God-willing, become a well-renowned author whose
              words move people. One day, I hope one of my stories is turned
              into a movie. That would be a dream come true.
            </p>
            <p class="about-extra">
              Iâ€™m passionate about making the world a better place â€” not just in
              big gestures, but in the daily effort of doing better than I did
              yesterday. I strive to make choices that honor my family, my
              countries, and the future generations that will come after me.
            </p>
            <p class="about-extra">
              I consider myself a leader. I'm always learning how to become a
              better one â€” through faith, responsibility, and growth. I believe
              in God â€” in Jesus Christ â€” and I fully trust His plan for my life.

          Iâ€™ve come a long way â€” in life, in distance, and in faith. Being
          healthy and having the opportunity to attend school in the United
          States is a blessing I donâ€™t take for granted. Every day is a gift.
          Iâ€™m here to make the most of it.
